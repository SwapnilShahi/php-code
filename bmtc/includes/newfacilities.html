The Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation will soon allow passengers to reserve seats in advance 
for their bus commute and also track the movement of their bus.
These features are to be integrated in the BMTC’s mobile application.

“This is a priority and the IT department is working on the proposal.
We are in touch with a few software developers who have already shown us proof of the concept.
The new feature will be out soon,” said V Ponnuraj, managing director of the corporation.

The subject of allowing advance booking had come up during a recent interactive meeting between IT companies, BMTC, 
the transport department and the city traffic police. The programme was organised at RMZ Ecoworld in Bellandur, 
the city’s largest IT campus that hosts 1 lakh employees.

During that interaction, it was revealed that over 60,000 vehicles (25,000 of them being cars) enter the Ecoworld campus every day. The campus authorities were willing to tie up with BMTC to encourage professionals who use personal transport to switch to public transport, said a BMTC official.

The new facilities would be made available for air-conditioned buses, especially the Vayu Vajra services (airport buses),
to begin with. “We were grappling with basic issues such as cleanliness, breakdown of buses and crew behaviour.
This has been sorted out. Now, we are looking at providing value-added services including digital payments and pre-booking of seats,
” the official added.

Another feature in the new app tackles the gap between the first and last-mile connectivity. 
“Along with the feature to prebook a seat, we are also considering the option of providing first and last-mile services, 
that is, from the bus stand to the doorstep. We will partner with cab aggregators and autorickshaws,” the official said.

Companies such as Ola and ZipGo had launched on-demand shuttle bus services in the city until they were suspended by the transport
department on grounds that there were regulatory issues. App-based on-demand service providers had used contract-carriage 
vehicles such as Tempo Travellers, which was against the transport department’s rule.

In Bengaluru, only BMTC has the permission to run stage-based transport services.
As BMTC services were insufficient, there was discussion on whether to allow private operators to run city bus service.


Ghanshyam AP, a software professional who is a BMTC regular between Hebbal and Kadubeesanahalli, 
said booking a bus in advance is a step in the right direction. “In the process, the transport corporation should ensure
punctuality,” he said.
